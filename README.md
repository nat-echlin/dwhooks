# dwhooks
Simple discord webhooks in Go. 

`go get github.com/nat-echlin/dwhooks`

Not a fan of the other Golang discord modules. This module includes just webhooks, and is as simple as possible. It only includes functionality that I wanted myself, so if something is missing, it's because I haven't found a need myself for it yet. Feel free to PR.
